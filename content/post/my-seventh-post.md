Not all good byes are sad,                    
"Move on", the heart says,                             
"Being stagnant is bad"                              
Bidding adieu is sometimes vital,                            
When having you around, nobody is glad...                        
And it is not that everything snaps between you two,                         
Memories, moments, nostalgia - sometimes happy.. at times sad!!!                 

To meet and part is how life is all about,                                   
For love, conversation, attention cannot be forced...                

any doubt???
