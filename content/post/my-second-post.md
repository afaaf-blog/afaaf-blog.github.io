"Why do you always smile"?, They ask,                   
"You don't have problems.. No unaccomplished task??"                          
"After all, you are no super woman, and life must be stressing you every day..."    
"Isn't it unpredictable, unforeseeable, whimsical for you.. don't you say???   
I nodded and beamed a huge smile at them,                           
"Yup, you are right!!                         
But, Tis not a bird - this life,                               
that can be ensnared by some cage...                       
It will unfold page by page..                                     
"Aahaa", they smirked, "so you pretend to be happy and gay??"                 
"All this calm composure is a facade, dare we say ??"                           
I took a deep breath and                             

Smiled ðŸ˜Š!!!!!!!!!!
