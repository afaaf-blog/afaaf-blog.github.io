How I wish ,you listen  to the scintillating sound of raindrops..             
Or the melody I hear in the birdie chirps...                 
I am much of a loner..                         
I enjoy my company ðŸ˜Š                                  
Can you just sit besides me, gaze stars                          
And listen to the silent symphony..                         

What I don't mouth, my eyes express it all,                         
My lowered eyelids too speak volumes, Of course, it is your call...                

Ohh !! How I love  to watch a clay pot being made??                
The sheer joy to witness something so beautiful to create...                    

And, yes... Who wouldn't want a solitaire on the finger..                 
But I would prefer your gaze on me to linger!!                   

I love it when you plant a kiss on my forehead..                      
Or making me cross the road, I really dread!! ðŸ˜Š                      
   
These desires are just like Corona...                     
Once they enter, never dead or old...                            
Kept them to myself.. You never asked..                            


I never told!!!
