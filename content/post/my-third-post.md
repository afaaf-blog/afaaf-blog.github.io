I don't talk much, an old habit.. If you could say,                 
I feign ignorance.. Ridicule if you may....                                

But my silence speaks volumes - unsaid, unheard and quiet,                  
When words lose their meaning,                        
Nothing seems right.....                              
I seek solace in solemn silence,                       
No questions raised,                                                      
My wounded heart has me, myself to console and warmly embraced...              

And No, I don't need anyone to wipe that fateful tear of mine...                   
The indomitable soul will soon find a way to rise and shine!!!!!!
