Words - sometimes Wonderful, Weird.. at times..                     
Wacky they can be,                                   
And Dark as the grime!!

Words - Why do they always need to have a meaning??                           
Why can they be more like Aves... Carefree, careless and boundless..                 

Words - where do they vanish when I need them the most???                            
Ain't they supposed to aide me when I am hurt And                       
Feel useless as a burnt toast???                                           

I'll tell you what I am about to do and the world will be indebted for ever..        
I'll find some Silent Words but shall need my silence or eyes to deliver...       

- Afaaf
