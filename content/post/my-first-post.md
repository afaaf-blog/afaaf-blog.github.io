"Where do you belong to, brother??",       
Was my pertinent question...                     
When I saw him vandalising on the streets..            
"Is it not your own people, city, country???"                
"Ohh", he said ," what do you know about being oppressed?"                  
"You don't treat us kind, so does our leader said!!!"                 
You pull us down , mess with our rites and ritual...                     
Our identity loss  ,our fear is perpetual!!!                       
I need a piece of this land, to thrive and                        
Have my way!!!                                              
The Fatwa declares, I must protect my faith, as he says!!!        
"Ain't you educated enough to fathom that he manipulates???"               
You were raiders, we took you in..                 
To share our land, resources, even the constitution               
But you better learn now how to live  sans the hatred..                
Humility equals weakness.. better be not understood and said !!!
