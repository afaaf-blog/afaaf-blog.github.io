The fairest blossom  of the spirit...
The very essence of being human..
Sincere sane sensitivity, 
Can only be solemn !!

And then.. why shouldn't we thank Him for the grace...
It boomerangs the positivity..
He never craves for the Praise

It engulfs with warmth,
Radiance as in a halo...
A soul in the heaven or a heaven in the soul grow!!!

Nature never obtrudes...
Owning is good but owing also should be the attitude ...
What the heart feels and the soul exudes, that is GRATITUDE!!!
