And the lock down taught me...                                      
To be my own camarderie...                                               
No Touch to let others survive.. on the contrary..                         

When going out becomes a curse,                                       
Why not take a trip inside to flatten the curve..                           

There exists a vast universe inside waiting to explore..                         
Listen to the muffled voices, I implore...                         

"Ohh!! I have no time for myself, so swamped with work"                     
These are things of past,                                  
Seek for that poet, painter, singer, dancer who got lost..                   

Your soul and it's abode on this earth both beseech you to pep them up..             
They demand a refill..                        
For you cannot pour from an empty cup!!!                                    

Life is a theatre,                                   
Play your part to the hilt,                                        
Let this 'New Normal' unlock you and give you wings
